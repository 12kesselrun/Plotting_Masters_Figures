# Most Recent Updates:
- Changed all attacks to show averaged tensile testing results instead of one line for each specimen

# Bug Fixes:
- Fixed the first three plots being "control specimen" by moving reset_output after "show"
- Fixed the error from the show on plots 4 and 5 by setting to a static line color (problem with indexing)

# To Do:
- Overlay Control specimen data on each attack test (make it see through, different color, and wider than the attack specimen data)
- Remove the outliers in the second plot
- Overlay Attacks 2-4 on top of each other
